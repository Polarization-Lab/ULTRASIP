1. Run ULTRASIP_Auto_Analysis: This calls ULTRASIP_Calculations.
	This code is how you get the non-uniformity corrected flux
	images and the stokes parameters and the AoLP and DoLP. These
	are automatically saved to the existing .h5 file

2. Run ULTRASIP_Read_Data: reads chosen .h5 file
	This code is to read the .h5 file and displays the NUC flux
	images, Stokes Parameters, AoLP and DoLP as images.
