ULTRASIP is an Ultraviolet Stokes Imaging Polarimeter developed by the Polarization Lab at the Wyant College of Optical Sciences at the University of Arizona. ULTRASIP was initially developed for imaging optically thin clouds but is currently being upgraded to provide ground-based remote sensing measurements of wildfire smoke.
