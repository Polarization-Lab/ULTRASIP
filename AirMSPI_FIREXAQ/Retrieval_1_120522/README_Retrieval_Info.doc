This folder holds the input, output, and retrieval figures for a GRASP retrieval performed on FIREX-AQ AirMSPI Data. 

Starting from the raw data (2 sequences):

These files were formatted into three different sdata files:

1. Just radiometric data channels denoted with an (I)
2. Just polarimetric data channels denoted with a (IQU)
3. All the data channels denoted with (ALL) 

Then with the given settings file the output from GRASP is also denoted I, IQU, or ALL depending on the input sdata file. 

The output figures similarly denoted, with 1-5 corresponding to the plots as listed in the python code.
